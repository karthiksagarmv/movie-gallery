This is a simple starter project.
**Movie Gallery**


A single page displaying card of movie data loaded from JSON. 

The data to be displayed is saved in JSON Array.  

**const movies = [  
  {  
      title:"",  
      description:"",  
      poster:"",  
      year:""  
  },  
  {  
  }  
  .  
  .  
  .  
]  

This is simple project involving three components -  

**Header**  
**Movie ( New component is created and rendered for every item in JSON Array )**  
**App ( The root Component :) )**
