This is a simple starter project.
**Movie Gallery**

The app is a single page displaying card of movie data loaded from JSON. 

This is simple project involving three components -  

**1)Header**  
**2)Movie ( New component is created and rendered for every item in JSON Array )**  
**3)App ( The root Component :) )**  

The data to be displayed is saved in JSON Array. 

    **const movies = [  
      {  
          title:"",  
          description:"",  
          poster:"",  
          year:""  
      },  
      {  
      }  
      .  
      .  
      .  
    ]  

      The data flow =>  

**Movies.js**  => **AppComponent** ( State ) => Passed as props to **Movie Component.**  
**Simple one :)

**Super Heroes in Action**
